# Dynamic No Man’s Sky Suit AI Voice Mod

Version: 1.1
Author: [[Bob-Harper](https://github.com)]
Repository: [[nms_dynamic_suit_voice](https://github.com/nms_dynamic_suit_voice)]

## Overview

This mod replaces static exosuit AI voice lines in No Man’s Sky with dynamically generated, non-repetitive lines, powered by a local AI model and localized audio DSP filters.

### Non-Negotiable Core Project Philosophies:
- **Local files ONLY.** No cloud processing, zero internet connection required, and absolutely no paid API subscription keys.
- **ENHANCE gameplay but NOT at the EXPENSE of gameplay.** Hardware footprints are stringently guarded.
- **Strict Single-Use Cache Vectors.** When pre-caching, generated audio files are completely overwritten after a single use, never reused.

## How the Tech Works

When No Man's Sky makes a sound call to play a suit voice line, it reads the physical file it finds inside your mod directory *at the exact moment it searches*. The game does NOT preload mod voice files into system memory when it launches. They load and play **EACH TIME** the game calls for that specific `.wem` file block, then are immediately unloaded until called again.

Because your local pipeline generates variations ahead of time into a protected background cache buffer, the system watcher instantly swaps a fresh file into your game folder the moment a line is loaded and played by the game. Every notification is completely new — even when mass-selling stacks of items at a space station terminal. No more repetitive *"Units Received. Units Received. Units Received."*

## Key Features (New in v1.1!)

- 🖥️ **Centralized Control Dashboard:** A graphical config interface (`960x820) to customize iteration names, swap engines, or fine-tune processing effects.
- 🎛️ **NumPy Acoustic Modifiers Matrix:** Six standalone sliders to control volume gain, sentence pacing, pitch semitones, rate scalars, throat size resonators, and cybernetic overlay mix balances.
- 🛸 **Themed Audio Presets:** Pre-calibrated, data-driven JSON presets that instantly transform standard voice clips into lore-friendly signatures like the *Gek NipNip Merchant*, *Vy'keen Juggernaut*, or *Caffeinated Korvax*.
- 🗄️ **Secure 8-Model Core Roster:** Built-in dynamic asset management for eight verified, high-performance, single-voice English baselines with crash-free automated download or uninstall hooks.
- 🧠 **Protected VRAM Performance:** Run fully on optimized CPU thread inference layouts, leaving your GPU completely free to push maximum frame rates to the game.

### 🛠️ Persistent User Configuration Matrix
Customizations are now securely saved directly to `config/user_customization.json`. This architecture ensures your personalized variables will **never be overwritten or wiped out** during future mod updates or repository git pulls.

- **First-Time Installation:** If this configuration file does not exist on your drive, the automated setup script will initialize it cleanly for you.
- **Upgrading the Mod:** If the file already exists with your custom settings, the engine boundaries will completely shield it from being touched.
- **Power-User Manipulation:** While changes can be made manually via any plain-text editor, the graphical **DSV Manager** interface reads natively from this profile map and saves your slider adjustments straight back to it when applying or saving changes.

## Examples of Dynamic Output Variations

- **Original Game Wording:** *Nearby toxins detected*
  - ↳ *Corrosive environmental toxins are causing damage to your suit's protective filters.*
  - ↳ *Corrosive environmental toxins are threatening the effectiveness of your suit's protective filters.*
  - ↳ *Corrosive environmental contaminants are debilitating your suit’s filtration system.*

- **Original Game Wording:** *Extreme Night Temperature Detected*
  - ↳ *Extreme night cold temperatures are reported, posing a threat to life support.*
  - ↳ *Extreme cold temperatures during the night cycle are detected, risking safety systems.*

## Current Verified Limitations

- **Mod Conflicts:** Completely incompatible with traditional static suit voice mods that drop pre-recorded audio `.wem` files directly into your standard game `MODS` folder.
- **VITS Architecture Block:** Advanced multi-speaker VITS models are intentionally excluded from the scan loader at this time to protect end-users from installing external C++ system binaries (such as eSpeak NG) onto their primary Windows environment paths.

## Installation & Deployment

### ⚡ Automatic or Guided Installation
Launch the primary command wrapper script:
```bash
DOUBLECLICK_To_Install_Dynamic_Suit_Voice.cmd
```
Choose **Automatic Mode** for a streamlined, minimal-click environment deployment, or choose **Guided Mode** to manually inspect path mappings, folder targets, and validation configurations step-by-step.

### 🛠️ Launching the DSV Manager
To customize your Exosuit experience, simply double-click the launcher script in your root mod folder:
```bash
run_manager.cmd
```
This instantly boots your graphical dashboard configuration utility, allowing you to fine-tune your **Iteration Designation**, swap active vocal models on the fly, or test-play custom presets inside the live real-time sandbox deck before starting your game session.

- Set your custom **Iteration Name**, calibrate your **Companion AI Tone Profiles**, or load your favorite alien voice presets inside the live sandbox panel.
- Click **Save & Close** (or leave it active via **Apply Changes** to tweak metrics on the fly while playing!).
- Fire up the background watchdog thread generator pipeline, launch No Man's Sky, and head out into the stars!

## Future Framework Roadmap (Version 1.2 and Beyond)
- 💾 **Custom User Profile Saving:** A local profile manager to let users write, name, and archive their own handcrafted audio preset slider files.
- 🎙️ **Bundled Zero-Install Masculine Vocal Registers:** Staging offline pre-compiled binary modules directly inside localized project folders to safely unlock native male voice models without complex user configuration scripts.
- 📦 **Native Python `sound2wem` Refactoring:** Completely absorbing audio compilation dependencies natively into pure Python memory streams to bypass calling shell execution windows entirely.
