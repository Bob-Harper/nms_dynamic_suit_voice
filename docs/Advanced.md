# Dynamic No Manâ€™s Sky Suit AI Voice Mod Advanced Options


## Can I use a different LLM inference pipeline? I would rather use (insert your favourite LLM package here)

Short answer:  yes

Longer answer: Not as written.  If you want to try your hand at switching to a Transformers pipeline, use HF models offsite, or
hook yourself up with an OpenAI pipeline or anything other than Ollama - have at it.  But it can and will likely involve
extensive rewrite and changes to that portion of the code.  That having been said, the only thing preventing other inference
methods at this time is the lack of motivation and expertise in setting up alternate LLM options.  I used to run LLM's
with customized python code but ever since I discovered Ollama I have left that world behind to focus on results and other
projects rather putting in time trying to reinvent the wheel.  I absolutely encourage anyone who wants to give their hand at
adding different options for their own (and/or other) use, but I fear I may not be of much help on specifics.

The basic concept of this pipeline remains unchagned however.

## Can I use a different voice generation model/package/online api/whatever, i hate the way this one sounds

As above.  Any voice package should work, it would just be a matter of swapping out old code for new code. I did attempt
to make this code as modular as possible - each of the tasks does it's own thing and it's own thing only - as long as the new solution
can accept the output of the previous step and create soething that the next step will accept, any of the base steps can
be changed up without affecting the others.

## What about the sound2wem converter?

I have not found another option that works this well.  Creating my own wem converter from scratch for about 3 weeks of
time I would like back was obviously a counterproductive effort - though I dont consider the time wasted as I did learn a LOT
more than I ever thought I would about game design, audio editing, and how the two work together.  Serious respect
for anyone who does that as their job.  But if someone finds a better or easier option, by all means let me know but
honestly i'm an very happy with the way this performs, even if it does require installing another entire github project.

## I dont like the voice lines

Then the transcript CSV in the data directory is your next stop.

## But what about (insert something not covered here)

Work in progress.  So much WIP.  ask and ye shall get some form of answer.at
